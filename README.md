A javascript implementation of a Genetic Algorithm on the Traveling Salesman Problem

## Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a procedure for solving optimization problems where there is not a clear analytical solution.
The GA heavily depends heavily on randomness and an evaluation metric to search the solution space effectively.
